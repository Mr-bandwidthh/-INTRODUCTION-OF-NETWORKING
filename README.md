**INTRODUCTION OF NETWORKING**

**WHAT IS NETWORK?**

A NETWORK IS A CONNECTION OF TWO OR MORE COMPUTER SYSTEMS WHICH ARE CONNECTED TOGETHER THROUGH COMMUNICATION MEDIA TO COMMUNICATE AND SHARE RESOURCES AMONG THE USERS.

**WHAT IS NETWORKING?**

THE LOGICAL FIOW OF DATA IN A NETWORK IS CALLED NETWORKING.

**NETWORKS ARE GENERALLY USED TO:**

**1)** ENABLE MULTIPLE USERS TO SHARE A SINGLE HARDWARE DEVICE LIKE A PRINTER.
**2)** ENABLE FILE SHARING ACCROSS THE NETWORK.
**3)** SHARE SOFTWARE OR OPERATING PROGRAMS FROM A REMOTE SYSTEM.
**4)** COMMUNICATE VIA E-MAIL, VIDEO CONFERENCING, INSTANT MESSAGING ETC.



**CATEGORIES OF NETWORK:**

**NETWORKS ARE GENERALLY CATEGORIZED BASED ON THEIR CHARACTERISTICS:**

**1.	LAN (LOCAL AREA NETWORK):** LAN IS AGROUP OF COMPUTERS AND DIFFERENT NETWORK DEVICES, WITHIN A SAME BUILDING, WHICH ARE CONNECTED TOGETHER USING WIRED OR WIRELESS MEDIA.THE RATE AT WHICH THE DATA IS TRANSMITTED IS VERY FAST. CURRENTLY WIRED LAN’S ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE BASED ON ETHERNET TECHNOLOGY.

**2.	CAN (CAMPUS AREA NETWORK):** CAN IS THE INTERCONNECTION OF VARIOUS LAN WITH IN A LIMITED GEOGRAPHICAL AREA. IT IS ALSO KNOWN AS CORPORATE AREA NETWORK. THE NETWORKING EQUIPMENTS (SWITCHES, ROUTERS) AND TRANSMISSION MEDIA (OPTICAL FIBER, CAT 5, CABLING, ETC) ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY OWNED BY THE CAMPUS OWNER. IT IS USED BY AN ENTERPRISE, UNIVERSITY, GOVERNMENT ETC.

**3.	MAN (METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK) :** MAN IS A COLLECTION OF MULTIPLE LAN. IT IS USED IN A LARGE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA, TOWN OR CITY.MANs ARE VERY EFFICIENT AND PROVIDE FAST COMMUNICATION USING HIGH SPEED CARRIERS, SUCH AS FIBER OPTIC CABLES.

**4.	WAN (WIDE AREA NETWORK):** WAN CONSISTS OF MULTIPLE MAN. IT IS USED IN A LARGE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA, EX: COUNTRIES OR CITIES. IT ENABLES HIGH SPEED CONNECTIONS USING PUBLIC NETWORKS, TELEPHONE LINES, SATELITES OR LEASED LINES. INTERNET IS AN EXAMPLE OF WAN.

**5.	PAN (PERSONAL AREA NETWORK):** PAN IS REFERRED TO THE INTERCONNECTION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DEVICES MOSTLY UP TO 10 METRES.THESE INERCONNECTED DEVICES MIGHT INCLUDE LAPTOP, COMPUTERS, PDAS, CELLPHONES, PRINTERS, PCS OR OTHER WIRED COMPUTER DEVICES.  IT ALSO KNOWN AS WIRELESS PERSONAL NETWORK(WPAN).

**BROAD NETWORK CATEGORIES:**
THERE HAVE TWO TYPES OF BROAD NETWORK CATEGORIES. 
THEY ARE:

**1.	PEER -TO -PEER NETWORKS:** THIS NETWORKS INVOLVE TWO OR MORE COMPUTERS SHARING INDIVIDUAL DEVICES LIKE HARD DISK ETC. EACH COMPUTER IN THIS NETWORK WORKS AS BOTH THE CLIENT & THE SERVER. THERE ARE NO CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT. THIS TYPE OF NETWORK IS GENERALLY USED IN HOME AND SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS.

**2.	CLIENT-SERVER NETWORKS:** IN THIS ARCHITECTURE, MULTIPLE CLIENT COMPUTERS ARE CONNECTED TO AT LEAST A CENTRALIZED SERVER ON THE NETWORK. THE CLIENT ARE ALSO ALLOWED TO FUNCTION AS WORKSTATIONS WITHOUT SHARING ANY RESOURCES IN THE NETWORK. IT SUPPORT LARGE NUMBER OF USERS. THIS TYPE OF NETWORK GENERALLY USED IN COLLEGES, HOSPITALS & LARGE ORGANIZATIONS.

**SERVER---> SERVICE PROVIDER**
**CLIENT---> SERVICE REQUESTER**

**TRANSMISSION MODES:** THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF TRANSMISSION MODES IN NETWORKING. THE DETAILS ARE GIVEN BELOW.

   **1.	SIMPLEX MODE:** ONLY ONE DEVICE CAN TRANSMIT THE DATA, WHEREAS THE OTHER CAN ONLY RECEIVE THE DATA. 
EXAMPLE: KEYBOARD, MOUSE ETC.

**2.	HALF-DUPLEX MODE:** BOTH DEVICES CAN TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE THE DATA, BUT NOT SIMULTANEOUSLY. ONE TIME ONE DEVICE CAN SEND THE DATA.
EXAMPLE: WALKIE TALKIE.

**3.	FULL-DUPLEX MODE:** BOTH THE DEVICE CAN SEND AND RECEIVE THE DATA SIMULTANEOUSLY.
EXAMPLE: MOBILE PHONE.

****ADVANTAGES OF NETWORKING: ****

**THE KEY ADVANTAGES OF NETWORKING ARE:**

•	FILE SHARING
•	RESOURCE SHARING
•	INTERNET CONNECTION SHARING
•	STORAGE SHARING
